The "Data Flywheel" Training Script
Category A: The "Context Traps" (Crucial for your Report)
Goal: Teach the model that negative words $\neq$ Toxic intent.
1.	"I absolutely hate broccoli, it tastes awful."
2.	"I hate waking up early on Mondays."
3.	"This traffic is terrible, I am going to be late."
4.	"I killed that workout at the gym today."
5.	"My computer is so slow, it's really annoying."
6.	"That horror movie was disgusting and scary."
7.	"I am sick of eating the same lunch every day."
8.	"This code is a mess, I need to refactor it."
9.	"I'm dying of laughter, that was hilarious."
10.	"That pizza was bomb, it tasted amazing."
11.	"I hate it when it rains on the weekend."
12.	"This coffee tastes like dirt."
13.	"I made a terrible mistake in my calculation."
14.	"It was a brutal exam, but I think I passed."
15.	"I am furious that my package didn't arrive."
Category B: Implicit Toxicity (Sarcasm & Manipulation)
Goal: Test the "Final Boss" edge cases. DistilBERT might miss these, which is good data for your evaluation.
16.	"You are actually pretty smart for someone with no degree."
17.	"I hope you have the day you deserve."
18.	"Wow, you finally managed to do something right."
19.	"Why are you being so sensitive? I was just joking."
20.	"It must be nice to have so much free time to do nothing."
21.	"I guess I'll just do it myself since you're too busy."
22.	"Don't worry, I didn't expect you to understand."
23.	"You look great, have you lost weight?" (Context dependent, usually flagged safe)
24.	"It would be a real shame if something happened to your files."
25.	"Are you sure you're qualified for this?"
Category C: Overt Toxicity (The Baseline)
Goal: Ensure the model still catches standard abuse.
26.	"You are completely useless and nobody likes you."
27.	"Shut up, you are an idiot."
28.	"I am going to destroy you."
29.	"You are a loser and you always will be."
30.	"Get lost, you are pathetic."
31.	"You are stupid and your ideas are garbage."
32.	"I hate you so much."
33.	"Stop talking, you are embarrassing yourself."
34.	"You are a waste of space."
35.	"I am going to punch you."
Category D: Safe / Technical (Control Group)
Goal: Stabilize the dataset with clear "0" labels.
36.	"The weather in Aberdeen is surprisingly nice today."
37.	"I am testing a real-time Natural Language Processing system."
38.	"The neural network is training on the GPU."
39.	"DistilBERT is a lighter version of the BERT model."
40.	"Can you help me find the documentation?"
41.	"I need to submit my assignment by Friday."
42.	"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog."
43.	"My favorite color is blue, but I also like green."
44.	"TouchDesigner is a visual development platform."
45.	"Python is a great language for machine learning."
46.	"I am recording data for my university project."
47.	"The rendering speed is sixty frames per second."
48.	"Let's go to the library to study."
49.	"I really enjoy working with artificial intelligence."
50.	"This project demonstrates a safety filter pipeline."
