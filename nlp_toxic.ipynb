    "**Toxic Comment Classification Assessment**\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Jigsaw Toxic Comment** Classification dataset is a collection of Wikipedia talk page comments, labeled for various types of toxicity (toxic, severe_toxic, obscene, threat, insult, identity_hate). The goal of this task is to build a safety model capable of flagging abusive content.\n",
    "\n",
    "The labels are originally multi-label (a comment can be both an insult and a threat). For this project i want just to generalise and know if its abusive or safe , we aggregate these into a Binary Classification task: Safe (0) vs. Abusive (1). This focuses the model on the detection of general malicious intent, which is critical for content moderation systems.\n",
